Hāmah is an interactive application designed to encourage reading, extracting insights, and benefiting from books in a meaningful way. The idea was born from one of the challenges we usually organize in the women’s interactive program under “Bard al-Yaqīn” — a program dedicated to strengthening Islamic certainty (yaqīn), protecting foundational beliefs, refuting doubts, and fostering spiritual purification (tazkiyah).

The app transforms the process of recording insights into an engaging experience. Each book is represented as a symbolic "garden." When a student starts reading a new book, she opens a new garden . As she records insights, her garden grows through different stages — reflecting her progress. The journey is enriched with motivational reminders, daily and weekly challenges, and rewarding titles for those who consistently contribute and engage.

Beyond gamification, Hāmah highlights the value of knowledge-sharing in an Islamic context. Students can view each other’s gardens, appreciate and evaluate shared insights, fostering a sense of community and encouragement. Importantly, the app emphasizes the beauty of the Arabic language as the primary medium of knowledge, preserving its central role in Islamic learning and nurturing a deeper connection with the heritage of our faith.
